to administer the functioning of the country. Only those who perform their duty towards the nation have the right to raise 
their voices against the system. It is our duty to vote for our representatives. Casting vote is the most effective medium of
communicating our grievances about the system. In recent years, corruption, violence and malpractices have grown to
a great extent in all spheres of life; politics has not remained untouched either. But then the people we choose to run the
government are from among us.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, with growing political corruption, people are being driven away from voting as they term all politicians 
the same. People neglect their responsibility which shows their social mind set. People fail to understand that to run the
country they need to elect, relatively good candidate to run the country. 
<br><br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voting is power and that power is in our hands. Therefore, we should use this power freely and wisely.</p> </span>
